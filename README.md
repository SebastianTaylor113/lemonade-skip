# lemonade-skip
The lemonade-skip is a Python program designed to allow users to easily traverse through chapters on the TestOut website. 

To start the program, users need to grab the URL of the chapter they want to start from on the Brightspace/D2L website and input it directly into the Python script when prompted. 
(NOTE: It needs to be in quotes, example: "https://wvnet.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/00000/viewContent/0000000/View") 

Users also need to input the number of iterations they want to go through before the program stops.

Once the URL and iteration amount are inputted, users can simply press the key ~ to start the program. 
The ~ key will start the loop, and the program will begin automatically traversing through the chapters on TestOut according to the number of iterations specified by the user. 
This makes it easy for users to quickly and efficiently navigate through the chapters on TestOut without having to manually click through each chapter themselves.
